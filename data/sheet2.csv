Planting trees protects the environment and helps to preserve traditional livelihoods and cultures for generations. Trees for the Future has been working in Haiti since early 2002 supporting projects throughout the country. Our program focuses on addressing the country and communities’ most urgent needs. Working with local farmers and farming groups, we are planting trees to reforest degraded hillsides, produce sustainable charcoal and fuel wood, produce biodiesel, and establish intensive hillside farming practices.This past season, we assisted 13 different communities along the Arcadine coast establish tree nurseries and receive the necessary training and resources to bring life back to the degraded hillsides. Communities came together and planted 500,000 trees this season. "

Although our mission is rooted in the Catholic faith, our operations serve people based solely on need, regardless of their race, religion or ethnicity. Within the United States, CRS engages Catholics to live their faith in solidarity with the poor and suffering of the world.   CRS established a presence in Haiti in 1954 to address the massive destruction and loss of life caused by tropical hurricane Hazel. CRS’ programs focused on humanitarian assistance and relief interventions. As the years have gone by, CRS has extended the scope of its assistance in Haiti government by implementing a variety of development-oriented programs, targeting the poorest households segments of the population.  CRS/Haiti’s partners include well-organized associations, school and health institutions, non-governmental and community based organizations (NGOs and CBOs), and the Diocesan Caritas commissions. CRS also maintains positive relationships with the public services and other safety net institutions in the context of emergency relief, planning, coordination and program implementation in the field. Although most of its activities are concentrated in the Southern Peninsula and in the West for safety net interventions, CRS also assists the populations of Northern and Central Haiti though projects carried out by the Diocesan Caritas offices.  CRS maintains two important offices in Haiti, in Port-au-Prince and in Les Cayes. Four others CRS offices representation are located in Jeremie, Miragoane, Gonaives and Port-de-Paix."
